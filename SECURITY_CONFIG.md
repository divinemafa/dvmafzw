# Security Configuration - BMC Platform

## 🔒 Directory Listing Protection Implemented

**Date**: October 7, 2025  
**Issue**: Directory listing was exposed on production (bitcoinmascot.com/app/, etc.)  
**Solution**: Multi-layered security approach

---

## ✅ Security Measures Implemented

### 1. **vercel.json Configuration**
- Added security headers (X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection)
- Blocked direct access to internal directories: `/app/`, `/components/`, `/contexts/`, `/libs/`, `/providers/`, `/supabase/`, `/specs/`
- Rewrites unauthorized access to custom 404 page
- Enforces clean URLs and no trailing slashes

### 2. **next.config.js Enhancements**
- Added comprehensive security headers including HSTS
- Disabled `X-Powered-By` header
- Enabled React strict mode and SWC minification
- Configured Permissions-Policy

### 3. **Custom 404 Page**
- Created `app/not-found.tsx` for graceful error handling
- Logs suspicious access attempts
- User-friendly interface with navigation options

### 4. **.vercelignore File**
- Prevents deployment of sensitive files
- Excludes documentation, config files, and database migrations

## 🚀 Deployment Instructions

1. **Commit changes:**
   ```bash
   git add vercel.json next.config.js app/not-found.tsx .vercelignore
   git commit -m "🔒 Security: Prevent directory listing and add security headers"
   git push
   ```

2. **Verify deployment:**
   - Wait for Vercel to redeploy
   - Test protected URLs:
     - https://bitcoinmascot.com/app/ → Should return 404
     - https://bitcoinmascot.com/components/ → Should return 404
     - https://bitcoinmascot.com/supabase/ → Should return 404

3. **Monitor logs:**
   - Check Vercel logs for any unauthorized access attempts
   - Review console warnings in browser dev tools

## 🛡️ Security Headers Enabled

| Header | Value | Purpose |
|--------|-------|---------|
| X-Content-Type-Options | nosniff | Prevents MIME type sniffing |
| X-Frame-Options | SAMEORIGIN | Prevents clickjacking |
| X-XSS-Protection | 1; mode=block | Enables XSS filter |
| Strict-Transport-Security | max-age=63072000 | Enforces HTTPS |
| Referrer-Policy | strict-origin-when-cross-origin | Controls referrer information |
| Permissions-Policy | camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=() | Restricts browser features |

## 📁 Protected Directories

- ✅ `/app/` - Application source code
- ✅ `/components/` - React components
- ✅ `/contexts/` - Context providers
- ✅ `/libs/` - Utility libraries
- ✅ `/providers/` - Provider components
- ✅ `/supabase/` - Database configuration
- ✅ `/specs/` - Project specifications

## ✅ Verification Checklist

- [ ] `vercel.json` deployed
- [ ] `next.config.js` updated with security headers
- [ ] Custom 404 page created
- [ ] `.vercelignore` configured
- [ ] Changes pushed to repository
- [ ] Vercel redeployed successfully
- [ ] Protected URLs return 404
- [ ] Security headers present in response
- [ ] No directory listing visible

## 🔍 Testing Commands

### Check security headers:
```bash
curl -I https://bitcoinmascot.com/
```

### Test protected directories:
```bash
curl -I https://bitcoinmascot.com/app/
curl -I https://bitcoinmascot.com/components/
curl -I https://bitcoinmascot.com/supabase/
```

Expected result: `HTTP/2 404` or redirect to home

## 📝 Notes

- All source code directories are outside `public/` (✅ already correct)
- Only static assets in `public/` are exposed
- Vercel automatically serves Next.js routes properly
- No `.htaccess` needed (Vercel handles routing)

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**If directory listing still appears:**
1. Check Vercel build logs
2. Verify `vercel.json` is in root directory
3. Ensure changes are deployed (check deployment timestamp)
4. Clear browser cache and CDN cache
5. Check Vercel dashboard → Settings → Environment Variables

**If 404 page doesn't appear:**
1. Verify `app/not-found.tsx` exists
2. Check Next.js App Router is enabled
3. Rebuild the application locally: `npm run build`
