### **2. Mobile Drawer Navigation**
**File:** `app/components/Navbar/Drawerdata.tsx`

**Added:**
- Dashboard link in mobile drawer menu
- Same position as desktop (between Exchange and FAQ)
- Route: `/dashboard`

**Features:**

### **3. Footer Links**
**File:** `app/components/Footer/index.tsx`

**Changes Made:**

#### Added Dashboard Link
- Dashboard added to "Useful Links" section
- Position: Between "Exchange" and "Tokenomics"

#### Fixed Link Routing ✨
Previously, all footer links pointed to `/` (home page). Now they route correctly:

**Link Mapping:**
```typescript
{
  'Home': '/',
  'Market': '/market',
  'Exchange': '/exchange',
  'Dashboard': '/dashboard',       // NEW
  'Tokenomics': '/#features-section',
  'FAQ': '/#faq-section',
}
```

**Footer Link Order:**
1. Home → `/`
2. Market → `/market`
3. Exchange → `/exchange`
4. **Dashboard → `/dashboard`** ⭐ (NEW)
5. Tokenomics → `/#features-section`
6. FAQ → `/#faq-section`

## 🔗 Dashboard Access Points

Users can now access the Dashboard from:

### **Desktop**
✅ Top navigation bar (between Exchange and FAQ)  
✅ Footer "Useful Links" section

### **Mobile/Tablet**
✅ Hamburger menu drawer (same position)  
✅ Footer "Useful Links" section

### **Direct URL**
✅ Navigate to: `/dashboard`

## 🎨 Design Consistency

All navigation elements maintain the existing design system:
- **Desktop Navbar:** White text with hover underline effect
- **Mobile Drawer:** Black text with gray hover background and purple text
- **Footer:** Off-white text with space-links styling

Dashboard link styling matches all other navigation items perfectly.
