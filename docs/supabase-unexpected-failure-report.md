# Supabase "Database error creating new user" Findings

## Key Takeaways
- Most reports trace the 500 `unexpected_failure` to custom triggers on `auth.users` that lack `SECURITY DEFINER`, reference tables without privileges, or rely on values (like `raw_app_meta_data`) that are not yet set at insert time. Removing or rebuilding these triggers resolves the failure in multiple cases.
- Supabase maintainers repeatedly advise inspecting Auth and Postgres logs immediately after a failed `createUser` call to capture the precise underlying SQL error, since the dashboard/API only returns the generic 500 response.
- Constraints or foreign keys attached to `auth.users` can also abort the transaction; relaxing constraints or moving the relationship to a separate table fixes the issue.
- Official guidance recommends recreating helper functions from the SQL "User Management" quickstart to ensure they run as `postgres`, plus using `RAISE LOG` inside trigger functions during debugging.
- When the trigger logic is unnecessary, dropping the function (with `CASCADE`) clears the failure; otherwise, grant the needed table permissions or rewrite the trigger to handle missing metadata safely.

## Suggested Next Steps
- Audit all triggers/functions on `auth.users`; temporarily disable them (or run `DROP FUNCTION <name>() CASCADE`) and retry user creation.
- If creation succeeds, rebuild the triggers using the `SECURITY DEFINER` pattern and add guard clauses for null metadata.
- If failures continue, query Auth/Postgres logs filtered by `supabase_auth_admin` to identify permission or constraint errors, and adjust schemas/constraints accordingly.
