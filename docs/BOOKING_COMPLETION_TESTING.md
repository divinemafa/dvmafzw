```

## Testing Workflow

### Test Case 1: Complete a Booking
1. Navigate to booking page: `/bookings/BMC-BOOK-83CBSH`
2. Verify status shows "Booking Confirmed" (blue card)
3. Click **"Service Completed?"** button
4. Verify confirmation dialog appears with:
   - Explanation text
   - Optional feedback textarea
   - Cancel and Confirm buttons
   - Security note about escrow
5. (Optional) Add feedback: "Great service, very professional!"
6. Click **"Confirm Completion"** button
7. Verify:
   - Loading state shows during API call
   - Success alert appears
   - Page refreshes automatically
   - Status changes to "Service Completed" (green card)
   - Completion timestamp is displayed
   - Payout notice is shown

### Test Case 2: Verify Database Updates
```sql
-- Check that completed_at was set
SELECT 
  booking_reference,
  status,
  completed_at,
  provider_response
FROM bookings
WHERE booking_reference = 'BMC-BOOK-83CBSH';
```

Expected Result:
- `status` = 'completed'
- `completed_at` = timestamp of completion
- `provider_response` = your feedback text (if provided)

### Test Case 3: Prevent Invalid Transitions
1. Try to complete a `pending` booking:
   - Navigate to: `/bookings/BMC-BOOK-LTFEX8`
   - Verify: No completion button shows (status is pending)
   
2. Try to complete an already completed booking:
   - Refresh the completed booking page
   - Verify: Shows "Service Completed" message (no button)

### Test Case 4: Cancel Confirmation
1. Navigate to a confirmed booking
2. Click "Service Completed?" button
3. Click **"Cancel"** button
4. Verify:
   - Dialog closes
   - Returns to confirmed status view
   - No API call was made
   - Status remains "confirmed"

### Test Case 5: Feedback Validation
1. Open completion dialog
2. Leave feedback empty
3. Click "Confirm Completion"
4. Verify: Uses default message "Service completed successfully"

5. Open completion dialog again (refresh page first)
6. Add custom feedback
7. Verify: Custom feedback is saved in `provider_response`

## API Testing (Optional)

### Direct API Call
```bash
curl -X PATCH http://localhost:3000/api/bookings/BMC-BOOK-83CBSH \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "status": "completed",
    "providerResponse": "Excellent service delivery!"
  }'
```

Expected Response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "booking": { ... },
  "message": "Booking completed successfully"
}
```

### Invalid Transition Test
```bash
# Try to complete a pending booking (should fail)
curl -X PATCH http://localhost:3000/api/bookings/BMC-BOOK-LTFEX8 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "status": "completed"
  }'
```

Expected Response (Error):
```json
{
  "error": "Cannot transition from pending to completed"
}
```
