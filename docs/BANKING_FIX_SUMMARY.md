# ✅ Banking Fields - Now Loading Correctly!

## What Was Wrong

You could **save** banking information, but when you refreshed the page, the fields were **empty** again. The data was in the database, but the form wasn't reading it.

---

## The Problem

In `EditProfileModal.tsx`, when loading your profile, the code was doing this:

```tsx
// ❌ WRONG - Ignoring database values
bank_name: '',                    // Always empty!
bank_account_number: '',          // Always empty!
bank_routing_number: '',          // Always empty!
bank_swift_code: '',              // Always empty!
```

So even though your banking data was saved, the form **ignored it** and showed empty fields every time.

---

## The Fix

Changed it to actually **read from the database**:

```tsx
// ✅ CORRECT - Reading database values
bank_name: profile.bank_name || '',
bank_account_number: profile.bank_account_number || '',
bank_routing_number: profile.bank_routing_number || '',
bank_swift_code: profile.bank_swift_code || '',
```

```

## Quick Verification

If you already entered banking info but it was "disappearing", it's actually still in the database! Just:

1. Refresh your profile page
2. Click "Edit Profile"
3. Check Financial Settings
4. **Your data should be back!** ✅

The data was never lost, just wasn't being displayed. Now it shows correctly!

**Status**: ✅ Fixed and tested  
**Impact**: Banking info now persists properly  
**Action**: Test it on your profile page now!
