# Profile Header Dashboard Stats Update

## Changes Made
Replaced generic marketplace stats (ratings, response time, completion rate) with **personal dashboard metrics** that are actually relevant to the logged-in user.

## New Stats Displayed

### 1. **Account Type** 
- Shows: Service Provider / Business / Individual
- Based on: `profile.user_type` from database
- Icon: User circle (blue)

### 2. **Verification Level**
- Shows: Unverified → Email Verified → Phone Verified → ID Verified → Fully Verified
- Based on: `verification.current_level` from database
- Color: Yellow (partial) → Emerald (verified)
- Icon: Shield with checkmark

### 3. **Profile Completeness**
- Shows: Percentage (0-100%)
- Calculated from 8 key fields:
  - Display name
  - Bio
  - Avatar image
  - Cover image
  - Phone number
  - City
  - Country
  - Wallet address
- Icon: Briefcase (purple)

### 4. **Premium Status** (conditional)
- Only shows if `profile.is_premium === true`
- Highlights with golden/yellow styling
- Icon: Sparkles

## Why These Changes?

**Before:** Showed N/A values for marketplace features (ratings, response time) that don't apply to personal dashboard view.

**After:** Shows actionable information that helps users understand:
- Their account configuration
- Verification progress
- Profile completion status
- Premium membership benefits

## Visual Design
- Each stat is a compact card with border and background
- Icons are color-coded by category
- Text hierarchy: label (small, muted) + value (bold, prominent)
- Premium status gets special golden styling to stand out

## Files Modified
- `app/profile/components/ProfileHeader.tsx`
