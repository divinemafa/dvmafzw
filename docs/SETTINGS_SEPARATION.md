## 📊 Tab Priority Order (Updated)

Dashboard tabs now ordered by business importance:

1. **Overview** - Dashboard home
2. **Content** ⭐ - Products/Listings (MOST IMPORTANT)
3. **Finance** - Money management
4. **Bookings** - Active appointments
5. **Reviews** - Customer feedback
6. **Clients** - Customer management
7. **Analytics** - Performance insights
8. **Messages** - Communication (supporting tool)
9. **Calendar** - Scheduling (supporting tool)
10. **Settings** - Business/product settings (supporting tool)

**Rationale**: Content (your products) is your business core, so it comes right after Overview.
