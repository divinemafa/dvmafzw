# Provider-Only Authentication Update

**Date**: October 8, 2025  
**Status**: Complete

## What Changed

### User Types Updated
- **REMOVED**: Client/Provider/Both options
- **ADDED**: Service/Business/Individual provider types
- **Reason**: Only sellers need dashboard access; buyers browse without accounts

### New Provider Types
1. **Service Provider**: Professional services (tutoring, plumbing, cleaning)
2. **Business**: Companies selling products/multiple services
3. **Individual Seller**: Freelancers, personal item sellers

### Files Modified
- `app/auth/register/page.tsx`: Updated user type selection cards
- `app/providers/AuthProvider.tsx`: Changed `ProviderType` from client/provider/both to service/business/individual
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md`: Added documentation rules

## Why This Matters

**Before**: Mixed authentication for buyers and sellers  
**After**: Dashboard only for providers who need to manage listings/sales

Buyers will get a lightweight account system later (messages, favorites only).

## Documentation Rules Added

All documentation now goes in `/docs` folder with:
- Maximum 300 words
- Clear sections: What/Why/Next
- No lengthy examples

## Next Steps

1. **Restart dev server**: Load environment variables
2. **Run database migrations**: Execute auth triggers SQL
3. **Test registration**: Create provider account at `/auth/register`
4. **Verify dashboard**: Only authenticated providers can access

## Database Impact

The `user_type` field now accepts: `service`, `business`, `individual` instead of `client`, `provider`, `both`.

Existing profiles with old types will need migration (future task).
