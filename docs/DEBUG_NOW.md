# 🐛 Debug Mode Activated - Language Feature

## What I Just Did

I've added **comprehensive debugging** to help us figure out why the language feature isn't working:

### 1. ✅ Added Console Logging
Every action now logs to the browser console:
- Button clicks
- Language additions
- Language removals
- Save operations
- Success/failure messages

### 2. ✅ Added Debug Panel
A **yellow debug box** now shows in the Languages section with:
- Current state of all variables
- Language arrays
- Profile data
- Save status
- "Dump to Console" button for detailed logs

### 3. ✅ Started Dev Server
Server is running on: **http://localhost:3001**

## 🔍 What to Do Now

### Step 1: Open the Profile Page
Go to: **http://localhost:3001/profile**

### Step 2: Scroll to Languages Section
You should see:
- Your current languages
- "+ Add Language" button
- **Yellow debug panel** (new!)

### Step 3: Click "+ Add Language"
**Watch the debug panel:**
- `isAddingLanguage` should change to `true`
- Input field should appear

**Check browser console** (F12):
- Should log: `🔘 Add Language button clicked`

### Step 4: Type a Language
Type: `spanish`

**Watch debug panel:**
- `Search query` should show: "spanish"
- `Filtered languages` should show: 1

### Step 5: Press Enter or Click Spanish

**Watch console for logs:**
```
➕ Adding language: Spanish
Current languages: ["English"]
Updated languages: ["English", "Spanish"]
💾 Saving languages: ["English", "Spanish"]
📤 Calling updateProfile with: ...
📥 Update result: ...
✅ Languages saved successfully
```

**If you see errors, copy them and share with me!**

## 🚨 Common Issues & What to Look For

### Issue 1: Button Click Does Nothing
**Check:**
- Debug panel: Does `isAddingLanguage` stay `false`?
- Console: Any JavaScript errors?
- Console: Does it log `🔘 Add Language button clicked`?

### Issue 2: Can Type But Language Doesn't Add
**Check:**
- Console: Does it log `➕ Adding language: ...`?
- Debug panel: Does `Languages count` increase?
- Console: Any errors after the ➕ log?

### Issue 3: Adds But Doesn't Save
**Check:**
- Console: Does it log `💾 Saving languages: ...`?
- Console: Does it log `📤 Calling updateProfile...`?
- Console: What does `📥 Update result` show?
- If error mentions "spoken_languages" column → Run: `supabase db push`

### Issue 4: Database Error
**Error:** `column "spoken_languages" does not exist`

**Fix:**
```bash
supabase db push
```

## 🧹 Cleanup Later

Once everything works, I'll remove:
- All `console.log()` statements
- The yellow debug panel
- This debug documentation
