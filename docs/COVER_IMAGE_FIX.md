# Cover Image Fix - Final Implementation

## What Changed
- **Removed all debug code** from ProfileHeader component
- **Simplified cover rendering** to use Next.js Image component with `unoptimized` flag
- **Increased cover height** from 32px to 48px (192px) for better visibility
- **Used Next Image with priority loading** to ensure cover loads immediately
- **Kept gradient as fallback** when no cover_image_url is set

## Implementation Details
The cover photo now renders with:
- `fill` layout for responsive sizing
- `priority` loading to prevent lazy-load delays
- `unoptimized` flag to bypass Next.js image optimization that might cache old versions
- `object-cover` to maintain aspect ratio
- `sizes="100vw"` for full-width responsiveness

## Files Modified
- `app/profile/components/ProfileHeader.tsx` - Stripped to essentials, removed all useState/useEffect debug logic

## Testing
Run `pnpm dev` and refresh the profile page with Ctrl+Shift+R (hard refresh) to clear any cached versions.

The cover image URL from the database will now render directly using Next.js Image component.
