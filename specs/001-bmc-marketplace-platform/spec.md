## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

**Service Provider Journey:**
Sarah, a house cleaner in South Africa, wants to list her cleaning services online. She creates an account, verifies her identity (email/phone), and creates a service listing for "Professional House Cleaning" priced at R500. She uploads photos of her work and her cleaning certification to her profile. When clients book her service, payment is held securely until she completes the work. After service completion, the client confirms, payment is released to Sarah, and both parties can leave reviews. Sarah earns BMC tokens for completing services and maintaining high ratings.

**Client Journey:**
Michael, a homeowner in the UK, needs a plumber urgently. He searches for "emergency plumber" on the platform, filters by "available now" and location, and reviews provider profiles including verification badges, ratings, and past work photos. He books a plumber, payment is held in escrow, and he can message the provider directly about the address and issue. After the plumber fixes his burst pipe, Michael confirms completion via the platform, payment is released to the provider, and Michael leaves a review earning BMC tokens as a reward.

**Platform Governance:**
Token holders receive a notification about a proposal to adjust the platform fee from 1.5% to 1.2%. They review the proposal details, discussion thread, and rationale. Token holders vote using their BMC tokens (1 BMC = 1 vote) over a 7-day period. The proposal passes with 68% approval and executes automatically after a 48-hour timelock, updating the fee structure across all transactions.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a new user visits the platform, **When** they complete registration with email and password, **Then** they receive a verification email and can access basic platform features within 3 minutes

2. **Given** a verified service provider, **When** they create a service listing with title, description, pricing (in local fiat), category, and images, **Then** the listing appears in the marketplace and can be discovered by clients searching that category

3. **Given** a client browses service listings, **When** they select a provider and book a service by choosing date/time and confirming payment, **Then** funds are locked in escrow, both parties receive booking confirmation, and a messaging channel opens between them

4. **Given** a service has been completed, **When** the client confirms service completion via the platform, **Then** payment is released from escrow to the provider's account, both parties can leave reviews, and both receive BMC token rewards

5. **Given** a provider uploads a document (certificate, portfolio image), **When** the upload completes successfully, **Then** the file is stored on IPFS, the reference is saved to their profile, and the file is accessible via their public profile

6. **Given** a client wants to communicate with a provider, **When** they send a message via the platform, **Then** the message is delivered in real-time (within 1 second), encrypted, and visible in both users' message threads

7. **Given** a user has earned BMC tokens, **When** they choose to stake tokens for fee reduction, **Then** they select a staking tier (1K/5K/10K/25K+ BMC), lock period (30/90/180 days), and their transaction fee is reduced accordingly (1.2%/0.9%/0.6%/0.45%)

8. **Given** a BMC token holder with 1,000+ tokens, **When** they create a governance proposal with title, description, and proposed action, **Then** the proposal enters a 3-day discussion period followed by a 7-day voting period where token holders can vote

9. **Given** a provider wants AI assistance, **When** they select "Generate Description" for their service listing and provide basic details, **Then** the AI generates a professional service description that the provider can edit and customize

10. **Given** a dispute occurs between client and provider, **When** either party initiates a dispute with evidence, **Then** the escrow remains locked, the case is flagged for multi-signature governance review, and both parties can submit additional information

### Edge Cases

- **What happens when** a provider cancels a booking after accepting?
  - Client is notified immediately, escrow funds are released back to client's account, provider's cancellation rate metric is updated, and the booking slot becomes available again
  
- **What happens when** a client disputes service quality but provider claims completion?
  - Escrow remains locked, both parties submit evidence (photos, messages, timestamps), case is reviewed by multi-signature governance council (5-of-9), decision is executed after review, and funds are distributed according to ruling
  
- **What happens when** a user forgets their password and loses access?
  - User initiates password reset via email, receives time-limited reset link, creates new password following security requirements (min 8 characters, mixed case, numbers, symbols), and can log in with new credentials
  
- **What happens when** uploaded file exceeds size limits or is inappropriate content?
  - File upload is rejected with clear error message indicating size limit (e.g., 50MB for images, 100MB for videos), user can compress/resize file and retry, inappropriate content is flagged by AI moderation and blocked from upload
  
- **What happens when** a provider tries to withdraw earnings but hasn't completed identity verification?
  - Withdrawal is blocked, user receives notification about required verification level, user is guided to complete Level 3 verification (Government ID), and after approval can proceed with withdrawal
  
- **What happens when** network congestion delays blockchain transaction confirmation?
  - User sees loading state with estimated confirmation time, transaction status is displayed (pending/confirming/confirmed), user receives notification when transaction completes, and fallback to cached data prevents UI blocking

- **What happens when** a service provider wants to create their own smart contract for their business operations?
  - Provider accesses "Advanced Services" section in their dashboard, selects "Create Smart Contract" option, chooses base chain (Solana or Stellar), uses guided contract builder or uploads custom contract code, deploys to testnet for validation, and after testing deploys to mainnet with gas fees paid in native tokens

- **What happens when** multiple clients try to book the same time slot simultaneously?
  - First confirmed booking locks the time slot, subsequent booking attempts receive "slot unavailable" message, clients are shown next available slots, and provider's calendar updates in real-time across all sessions
